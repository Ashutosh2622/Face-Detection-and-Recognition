# Face Detection & Recognition

This Face Detection and Recognition System is based upon the JavaScript face recognition API for the browser and nodejs implemented on top of tensorflow.js core.
It allows real time face detection and recognition in the browser.

# What is face-api.js ?
face-api is a JavaScript library created by Vincent MÃ¼hler., to detect faces via browser. It is built over tensorflow.js core API. It supports Face Detection, Face Recognition, Face Expression, Age, and Gender Detection.


## Installation

The following face-api repository can be cloned

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js.git

```
if you have npm installed

```bash
npm i face-api.js
```
    
## Functionality Supported

1. Face Detection:
   The Face Detection feature allows us to detect face in real time through webcam and predicts one's facial expression and age.
2. Face Recognition:
   The Face Recognition feature allows us to recognize faces with the help of previous data.
The face samples should be uploaded in the labelled_images folder. The test_images folder contains images to be tested.

NOTE: Both these folders should be hosted on an online platform.
## Steps To Navigate Website

The index.html or home.html folders contain the overall structure of the website.

1. Select Face Detection in order to detect faces in real time.
2. Select Face Recognition in order to recognize faces based on some previous data.
Wait for the models to load , once loaded you can upload an image from test_images to test the feature.
## Need!

We all have a longing for a SECURE life.

This Face Recognition and Detection System aims for the same. India has seen a recent surge in surveillance , with CCTV cameras being installed at every corner of street and has also made its way to people's home.

This System when integrated with the surveillance systems can predict the age and facial expressions , which will help us in determing what type of people were present at the place of crime scene , what their mental status was. 

Moreover people around can be tested , that whether someone in the vicinity of the crime scene has some previous criminal records.

## Vision & Goal

The  Vision of this project is to make it more efficient by Integrating both the features mentioned above into one.

The dataset can be increased further with information of all the people in the town or area. This will enhance the interrogation process.

Also people having previous criminal records can be spotted instantly around the crime scene if they were present there.
